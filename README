               Custom configuration files for Sculpt OS
               ========================================


This repository hosts config files for building a customised Sculpt OS. Since
the 22.02 release of the Genode OS Framework (https://genode.org), Sculpt is
highly modularised and configurable. This repository hosts the config files for
building a customised Sculpt OS that I like to use on a daily basis.

To use it, you first need to obtain a clone of Genode:

! git clone https://github.com/genodelabs/genode.git genode

Now, clone the _sculpt.git_ repository to _genode/repos/sculpt_:

! git clone https://github.com/jschlatow/sculpt.git genode/repos/sculpt

Follow along the instructions for building a Sculpt image from the latest Sculpt
documenation (https://genode.org/documentation/articles/index). Do not forget,
though, to add the following line to your _etc/build.conf_:

! REPOSITORIES += $(GENODE_DIR)/repos/sculpt
